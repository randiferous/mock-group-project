# mock-group-project
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to communicate with a team when working on a coding assignment. This task requires many qualities that are important in the workplace, such as clarity, responsibility, and affability. Furthermore, it is helpful to understand the types of people you are working with and what they are capable of. This will provide a better idea of how to communicate and work with them.

Another purpose of this project is being able to read through documentation and figure out how to use a certain API or framework in a timely manner. By requiring us to use at least 2 server-side APIs, we had to become aware of the kind of information available to us and how to access it.  And by requiring us to use a new CSS framework, we had to become familiar with a whole new set of class names and functionalities.

In our first meeting, our group was able to immediately agree on an application idea. We were aware of the pitfall of spending too much time coming up with a feasible idea and understood it would be better to dedicate more time to the technical aspect of the project. We are also able to successfully establish our GitHub workflow by connecting all of our local repos to one remote repository and testing pushes and pulls from it.


Covid 19 related app? 
I like this idea. Quite relevant. Might look good on a portfolio.
- Disease.sh provides country and state info
confirmed, recovered & deaths
administered, people vaccinated, partially vaccinated

- restcountries has decent api info

Material UI is recommended (having trouble setting up, so still might use Materialize)
Bulma is a great alternative
Animate.css for final touches
(let group decide on this)

Bulma vs Foundation
- Foundation less line of code
- Bulma has more features to play with
- both are simple 

Jira kanban is recommended, but might stick to github issues for convenience

api integration can be done before/separately from html basic layout
- one of the hardest parts will be choosing proper api

- tourism app or covid tracker
- choosing two API servers to use is a difficult task in an of itself
- figuring out something in new CSS framework can lead to multiple other discoveries
- modal might be an issue
- improvements: add vaccination info, make input field a dropdown menu, avoid repeats, add commas within the numbers, prevent non-country names from being added to search history, prevent repeated country names
- have create branches for 3 people (branch-daryl, branch-danny branch-sam)???
- throughout project, i had to ask myself: am i forcing something? or can I settle for an easier simpler approach?
- making this responsive is something to keep track of
- why doesn't background cover full page
- button size is bothering me

Issue with Bulma: a lot of different fonts going on
Issue with restcountry api: when searching for China, grabs Hong Kong first

Technology used: Discord, Bulma
