# mock-group-project
Covid 19 related app? 
I like this idea. Quite relevant. Might look good on a portfolio.
- Disease.sh provides country and state info
confirmed, recovered & deaths
administered, people vaccinated, partially vaccinated

- restcountries has decent api info

Material UI is recommended (having trouble setting up, so still might use Materialize)
Bulma is a great alternative
Animate.css for final touches
(let group decide on this)

Bulma vs Foundation
- Foundation less line of code
- Bulma has more features to play with
- both are simple 

Jira kanban is recommended, but might stick to github issues for convenience

api integration can be done before/separately from html basic layout
- one of the hardest parts will be choosing proper api

- tourism app or covid tracker
- choosing two API servers to use is a difficult task in an of itself
- figuring out something in new CSS framework can lead to multiple other discoveries
- modal might be an issue
- improvements: add vaccination info, make input field a dropdown menu, avoid repeats, add commas within the numbers
- have create branches for 3 people (branch-daryl, branch-danny branch-sam)???
- throughout project, i had to ask myself: am i forcing something? or can I settle for an easier simpler approach?
- making this responsive is something to keep track of
- why doesn't background cover full page

Issue with Bulma: a lot of different fonts going on
Issue with restcountry api: when searching for China, grabs Hong Kong first

- 1st meeting: settle on an idea, and establish github workflow (testing pushes and pulls)
